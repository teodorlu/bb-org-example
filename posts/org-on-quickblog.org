#+TITLE: Org-mode on Quickblog?

Before putting together this little repo, I wanted to "just add Org support to [[https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog][Quickblog]]".
Quickblog is Michiel's zero-hassle too to write markdown then, publish it on the web.
I quickly found out that Quickblog had grown more than I expected!
So instead of messing around in a Quickblog fork, I started here, on the side.

So I took Jack Rusher's advice, and elected to make a small thing on the side instead.
Maybe getting it integrated is feasible as a next step.
